#' @author Ramyar Molania

#' @description
#' This function contains three different functions including 'findNcgByTwoWayAnova', 'findNcgAcrossSamples' and
#' 'findNcgPerBiologyPerBatch' to find a set of genes as negative control genes (NCG) for RUV-III-PRPS normalization. We
#' refer to each function for more details.

#' @param se.obj A SummarizedExperiment object.
#' @param assay.name Character. Indicates the name of the assay in the SummarizedExperiment object. This assay should
#' be the one that will be used for RUV-III-PRPS normalization. We recommend using raw data.
#' @param bio.variables Character. Indicates the column names that contain known biological variable(s) in the
#' SummarizedExperiment object. These biological variables can be categorical or continuous. Continuous variables will be
#' divided into 'nb.bio.clusters' groups based on a clustering method selected in the 'bio.clustering.method' argument.
#' This argument cannot be empty.
#' @param uv.variables Character. Indicates the column names that contain unwanted variable(s) in the SummarizedExperiment
#' object. These unwanted variables can be categorical or continuous. Continuous variables will be divided into
#' 'nb.uv.clusters' groups based on a clustering method selected in the 'uv.clustering.method' argument. This argument
#' cannot be empty.
#' @param approach Character. Indicates which NCGs selection method should be used. The options are 'AnovaCorr.PerBatchPerBiology',
#' 'AnovaCorr.AcrossAllSamples' and 'TwoWayAnova'. The default is set to 'TwoWayAnova'. Refer to details for more information.
#' @param ncg.selection.method Character. Indicates how to summarize F-statistics obtained from two-way ANOVA and select a
#' set of genes as negative control genes. The options are 'prod', 'average', 'sum', 'non.overlap', 'auto', and 'quantile'.

#' @param regress.out.bio.variables Character. Indicates the column names that contain biological variables in the
#' SummarizedExperiment object. These variables will be regressed out from the data before finding genes that are highly
#' affected by unwanted variation. The default is 'NULL', indicating regression will not be applied.
#' @param regress.out.uv.variables Character. Indicates the column names that contain unwanted variation variables in the
#' SummarizedExperiment object. These variables will be regressed out from the data before finding genes that are highly
#' affected by biological variation. The default is 'NULL', indicating regression will not be applied.

#' @param assess.ncg Logical. Indicates whether to assess the performance of selected NCG or not. This analysis involves
#' principal component analysis on only the selected NCG and then exploring the RÂ² or vector correlation between the 'nb.pcs'
#' first principal components and the specified variables.
#' @param variables.to.assess.ncg Character. Indicates the column names of the SummarizedExperiment object that contain
#' variables whose association with the selected genes as NCG needs to be evaluated. The default is 'NULL'. This means all
#' the variables specified in the 'bio.variables' and 'uv.variables' will be assessed.
#' @param nb.pcs Numeric. Indicates the number of the first principal components of selected NCG to be used to assess
#' the performance of NCGs. The default is 5.

#' 'checkSeObj' will be applied. The default is set to 'TRUE'.
#' @param remove.na Character. Indicates whether to remove NA or missing values from either the 'assays', 'sample.annotation',
#' 'both' or 'none'. If 'assays' is selected, the genes that contain NA or missing values will be excluded. If
#' 'sample.annotation' is selected, the samples that contain NA or missing values for any 'bio.variables' or
#' 'uv.variables' will be excluded. The default is set to 'none'.
#' @param save.se.obj Logical. Indicates whether to save the result in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment object or
#' to output the result as a logical vector. The default is set to 'TRUE'. The file will be saved in
#' 'se.obj@metadata$NCG$supervised$output.name".
#' @param output.name Character. A representation for the output's name. If set to 'NULL', the function will choose a name
#' automatically. In this case, the file name will be constructed as paste0(sum(ncg.selected),'|', paste0(bio.variables,
#' collapse = '&'), '|', paste0(uv.variables, collapse = '&'),'|TWAnova:', ncg.selection.method, '|', assay.name).
#' @param ncg.group Character. A symbol indicating the name of the group of NCG.

#' @param use.imf Logical. Indicates whether to use the intermediate file or not. The default is set to 'FALSE'.
#' @param save.imf Logical. Indicates whether to save the intermediate file in the SummarizedExperiment object or not.
#' If set to 'TRUE', the function saves the results of the two-way ANOVA. Subsequently, if users wish to adjust parameters
#' such as 'nb.ncg', 'ncg.selection.method', 'top.rank.bio.genes', and 'top.rank.uv.genes', the two-way ANOVA will not
#' be recalculated. This accelerates parameter tuning for NCG selection. The default value is 'FALSE'.
#' @param imf.name Character. Indicates the name to use when saving the intermediate file. If set to 'NULL', the function
#' will create a name. In this case, the file name will be constructed as
#' paste0(assay.name, '|TwoWayAnova|', ncg.selection.method). The default is 'NULL'.
#' @param verbose Logical. If 'TRUE', shows the messages of different steps of the function.

#' @return Either the SummarizedExperiment object containing a set of negative control genes in the metadata or a
#' logical vector of the selected negative control genes.
