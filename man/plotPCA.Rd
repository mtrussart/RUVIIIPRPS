\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{assay.names}{Character or vector. A character string or a vector of strings specifying the name(s) of the assay(s)
in the SummarizedExperiment object for computing principal components (PCs). By default, all assays in the SummarizedExperiment
object will be selected.}

\item{variable}{Character. The name of the column in the sample annotation of the SummarizedExperiment object that
contains either a categorical or continuous variable. If a continuous variable is provided, the function creates scatter
plots of each PC against the variable. If a categorical variable is provided, the function can generate pairwise scatter
plots of the first principal components, colored by the categorical variable, or create boxplots of each PC across the variable.}

\item{fast.pca}{Logical. Indicates whether to use the pre-computed fast PCA or not. The default is set to 'TRUE'. Refer
to the computePCA' function for more details.}

\item{nb.pcs}{Numeric. A numeric value specifying the number of principal components to be used for plotting. The
default is set to 3. Itâ€™s important to note that the variation in the PCs for the selected subset will be based solely
on the chosen number of PCs.}

\item{plot.type}{Character. Specifies which type of plot should be generated. Options are: 'scatter' and 'boxplot'.
The default is set to 'scatter'. Note that the 'plot.type' cannot be set to 'scatter' if a categorical variable is provided.}

\item{variable.colors}{Character vector. Specifies the colors to be used in scatter plots of PCs when a categorical
variable is provided. If 'NULL', the function will use the default color scheme.}

\item{points.size}{Numeric. A numeric value specifying the size of the points in the scatter PCA plots. The default
is set to 1.}

\item{stroke.color}{Character. Specifies the color of the stroke around the points in the scatter PCA plots. The default
is set to 'gray'.}

\item{stroke.size}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the thickness of the stroke around the points in the scatter PCA plots.
The default is set to 0.1.}

\item{points.alpha}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the transparency of the points in the scatter PCA plots. The
default is set to 0.5.}

\item{densities.alpha}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the transparency of the density plots in the scatter PCA plots.
The default is set to 0.5.}

\item{legend.position}{Character. Specifies the position of the plot legend. This setting applies when a categorical
variable is provided, and the 'plot.type' is set to 'scatter'. Options are: 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left'. The
default is set to "bottom".}

\item{plot.ncol}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the number of columns in the plot grid. When more than one assay
is selected,
the function arranges all the PCA plots in one grid.}

\item{plot.nrow}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the number of rows in the plot grid. When more than three assays
are selected,
the function arranges all the PCA plots in one grid.}

\item{plot.output}{Logical. If 'TRUE', the individual PCA plot(s) will be displayed as the function runs.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the plots in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment object
or to output the results as a list. By default, this is set to 'TRUE'.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If 'TRUE', process messages will be displayed during execution.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object containing the PCA plot(s) in its metadata, or a list containing the PCA plot(s).
}
\description{
This function generates scatter and boxplots of the first principal components (PCs) of the assay(s) in a
SummarizedExperiment object. The function can generate pairwise scatter plots of the first principal components,
colored by a categorical variable, or create boxplots of each PC across the variable. Boxplots of principal components
are especially useful when the levels of a categorical variable are numerous, making visualization through colored
scatter plots challenging. If a continuous variable is provided, the function creates scatter plots of each PC against
the variable.
