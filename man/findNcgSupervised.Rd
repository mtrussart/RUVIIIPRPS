SummarizedExperiment object. These variables will be regressed out from the data before finding genes that are highly
affected by unwanted variation. The default is 'NULL', indicating regression will not be applied.}

expression and a continuous variable.}

\item{min.sample.for.aov}{Numeric. Indicates the minimum number of samples to be present in each group before applying

first principal components and the specified variables.}

\item{variables.to.assess.ncg}{Character. Indicates the column names of the SummarizedExperiment object that contain
variables whose association with the selected genes as NCG needs to be evaluated. The default is 'NULL'. This means all

\item{output.name}{Character. A representation for the output's name. If set to 'NULL', the function will choose a name
automatically. In this case, the file name will be constructed as paste0(sum(ncg.selected),'|', paste0(bio.variables,
collapse = '&'), '|', paste0(uv.variables, collapse = '&'),'|TWAnova:', ncg.selection.method, '|', assay.name).}

\item{save.imf}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the intermediate file in the SummarizedExperiment object or not.
If set to 'TRUE', the function saves the results of the two-way ANOVA. Subsequently, if users wish to adjust parameters
such as 'nb.ncg', 'ncg.selection.method', 'top.rank.bio.genes', and 'top.rank.uv.genes', the two-way ANOVA will not
be recalculated. This accelerates parameter tuning for NCG selection. The default value is 'FALSE'.}

will create a name. In this case, the file name will be constructed as
paste0(assay.name, '|TwoWayAnova|', ncg.selection.method). The default is 'NULL'.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If 'TRUE', shows the messages of different steps of the function.}

\description{
This function contains three different functions including 'findNcgByTwoWayAnova', 'findNcgAcrossSamples' and
'findNcgPerBiologyPerBatch' to find a set of genes as negative control genes (NCG) for RUV-III-PRPS normalization. We
refer to each function for more details.
